# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
 * *Not very confident but it needs more practice and just understanding what I'm doing and why I'm doing it. I know there finally comes the aha moment where it clicks.*
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
 * *I'm feeling a little reliant on my cohorts and find it can often save time.*
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
 * *Are there some methods that can only be assigned to certain types of variables because I'm not getting a return I expect the the second exercise of method variables?*
